Important policy notes

Request

    playlist_id
    string
    Required

    The Spotify ID of the playlist.
    Example: 3cEYpjA9oz9GiPac4AsH4n
    market
    string

    An ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. If a country code is specified, only content that is available in that market will be returned.
    If a valid user access token is specified in the request header, the country associated with the user account will take priority over this parameter.
    Note: If neither market or user country are provided, the content is considered unavailable for the client.
    Users can view the country that is associated with their account in the account settings.
    Example: market=ES
    fields
    string

    Filters for the query: a comma-separated list of the fields to return. If omitted, all fields are returned. For example, to get just the playlist''s description and URI: fields=description,uri. A dot separator can be used to specify non-reoccurring fields, while parentheses can be used to specify reoccurring fields within objects. For example, to get just the added date and user ID of the adder: fields=tracks.items(added_at,added_by.id). Use multiple parentheses to drill down into nested objects, for example: fields=tracks.items(track(name,href,album(name,href))). Fields can be excluded by prefixing them with an exclamation mark, for example: fields=tracks.items(track(name,href,album(!name,href)))
    Example: fields=items(added_by.id,track(name,href,album(name,href)))
    additional_types
    string

    A comma-separated list of item types that your client supports besides the default track type. Valid types are: track and episode.
    Note: This parameter was introduced to allow existing clients to maintain their current behaviour and might be deprecated in the future.
    In addition to providing this parameter, make sure that your client properly handles cases of new types in the future by checking against the type field of each object.

popularity
integer

The popularity of the track. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.
The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.
Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity. Note: the popularity value may lag actual popularity by a few days: the value is not updated in real time.
