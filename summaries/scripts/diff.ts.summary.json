  "summary": "This TypeScript file defines a `DiffCapturer` class that provides functionality to capture the git diff of the staged changes and generate a commit command template based on the diff. The main purpose of this script is to automate the process of generating a commit message and providing a clear overview of the changes that are about to be committed. The key functionality of the `DiffCapturer` class includes: 1. **Executing Git Diff**: The `executeGitDiff` method runs the `git diff` command with specific arguments (e.g., `--staged`, `--ignore-space-change`, `--ignore-blank-lines`) and returns the diff output as a string. 2. **Capturing Diff**: The `captureDiff` method generates a commit command template based on the diff output. It includes a header with the current timestamp and the `git diff` command used, the diff output, and a footer. This information is then written to a file named `paste.txt`, which can be used as a reference for creating a meaningful commit message. 3. **Verbose Logging**: The `DiffCapturer` class has an optional `verbose` flag that, when set, will log debug messages during the execution of the script. The script also includes a main block that checks if the file is being executed directly (not imported as a module). In this case, it parses the command-line arguments, creates a `DiffCapturer` instance, and calls the `captureDiff` method with the provided target (if any). The main purpose of this script is to streamline the commit process by providing a structured format for the commit message and a clear overview of the changes being committed.",
