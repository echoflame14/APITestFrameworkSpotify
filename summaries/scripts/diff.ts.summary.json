  "summary": "This TypeScript file defines a `DiffCapturer` class that provides a utility for capturing and saving the Git diff of the current repository state. The main purpose of this class is to generate a file named `paste.txt` that contains the Git diff output, along with a pre-populated commit command template. The key functionality of this class includes: 1. **Executing Git Diff**: The `executeGitDiff` method runs the `git diff` command with the specified target (e.g., `HEAD`) and captures the output. 2. **Capturing Diff**: The `captureDiff` method generates the `paste.txt` file, which includes:    - A commit command template with instructions for the user to follow.    - The Git diff output, prefixed with a header containing the current date and the target branch/commit.    - The file is created with executable permissions (mode `0o755`) to make it convenient for the user to run the generated commit command. 3. **Logging and Verbosity**: The class has a `verbose` flag that controls whether debug messages are logged to the console. The file also includes a main execution block that checks if the script is run directly (not imported as a module). In this case, it creates a new `DiffCapturer` instance, passing the `verbose` flag based on the command-line arguments, and calls the `captureDiff` method with the specified target (if provided).",
