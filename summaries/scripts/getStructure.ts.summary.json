  "summary": "This TypeScript file contains the implementation of a `StructureScanner` class, which is designed to scan a directory and generate a concise summary of its structure. The main purpose of this code is to provide a way to quickly understand the contents of a directory, especially in the context of a larger codebase. The key functionality of this code includes: 1. **Directory Scanning**: The `scanDirectory` method recursively scans a directory, creating a `DirectoryNode` object for each file and directory found. The `DirectoryNode` contains information about the file or directory, such as its name, type, path, and the number of tokens in the file (for files). 2. **Ignoring Patterns**: The class has a set of ignored patterns, such as `node_modules`, `dist`, and `.git`, which are used to exclude certain directories and files from the scan. 3. **Token Counting**: For each file, the `calculateTokens` method provides a conservative estimate of the number of tokens in the file content, which can be useful for understanding the relative complexity of different parts of the codebase. 4. **Prompt Generation**: The `generateInstructionPrompt` method generates a formatted prompt that can be used to request specific file summaries or full file contents from a user or another system. The prompt includes the directory structure and instructions for how to format the requests. 5. **Clipboard and File Output**: The code at the bottom of the file demonstrates how the `StructureScanner` can be used to generate a directory structure prompt, save it to a file (named `paste.txt`), and copy it to the clipboard (if the `clipboardy` library is available). In summary, this TypeScript file provides a tool for quickly understanding the structure of a directory, which can be useful in the context of code review, project exploration, or documentation generation.",
