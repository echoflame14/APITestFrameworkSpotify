  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide a tool for scanning a directory structure, analyzing its contents, and generating a structured representation of the directory tree. The key functionality includes: 1. **Directory Scanning**: The `StructureScanner` class scans a given root directory, recursively processing files and directories, and creating a `DirectoryNode` representation of the structure. 2. **Token Counting**: For each file, the tool calculates an estimated \"token count\" based on the file's content size, which can be useful for understanding the complexity of individual files. 3. **Formatting and Visualization**: The `formatTree` method generates a formatted string representation of the directory structure, using Unicode symbols to visually represent files and directories. 4. **Instruction Prompt Generation**: The `generateInstructionPrompt` method creates a detailed instruction prompt that can be used to guide the analysis of the code, including recommendations for requesting file summaries and full file contents. 5. **Output and Clipboard Integration**: The file includes a main execution block that scans the current working directory, saves the output to various files (JSON, TXT), and attempts to copy the instruction prompt to the clipboard (if the `clipboardy` library is available). The main use case for this tool is to provide a concise overview of a code project's directory structure, along with guidance for efficiently exploring the codebase by requesting file summaries and full file contents as needed. This can be particularly helpful when working with large or unfamiliar codebases.",
