  "summary": "The provided code is a part of a TypeScript codebase for a Spotify-related application. The main purpose of this code is to handle the interaction with Spotify's Playlist and Track API endpoints. Key functionality: 1. **PlaylistService**:    - Retrieves playlists owned or followed by a Spotify user.    - Fetches detailed playlist information from Spotify's API.    - Validates user playlist parameters and playlist responses.    - Handles various types of errors related to playlists, such as invalid IDs, not found playlists, and rate limit errors. 2. **TrackService**:    - Fetches detailed track information from Spotify.    - Validates the track response, ensuring required fields are present and the type is correct.    - Handles errors related to track requests, such as invalid IDs and market codes. The code utilizes a base service class (`BaseService`) and various error handling utilities provided by the `core/http/errors` module. The services also make use of the `types/spotify` module for defining the data structures related to playlists and tracks. The main focus of this code is to provide a robust and error-handling layer for interacting with the Spotify API, ensuring that the responses are properly validated and that relevant error information is provided to the calling code.",
