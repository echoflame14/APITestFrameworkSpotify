  "summary": "The main purpose of this .txt file is to provide a template for generating a commit command with a semantic commit message, along with detailed changes in a bullet point format. The key functionality includes: 1. Generating a single `-m` argument for the commit command, following the format \"type(scope): brief summary\". 2. Allowing the user to add detailed changes using bullet points. 3. Escaping quotes with `\\\"` in the commit message. 4. Capturing the Git diff content between the current HEAD and the working directory, and including it in the generated `paste.txt` file. The generated `paste.txt` file contains the commit command template, along with the Git diff content, and is made executable (mode `0o755`) to make it convenient for the user to run the generated commit command.",
