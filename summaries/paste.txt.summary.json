  "summary": "Understood. Let's proceed step-by-step: 1. Summaries needed to understand the context: ``` structure.json.summary.json,summary package.json.summary.json,summary ``` 2. After reviewing the summaries, the following full files seem relevant: ``` src/services/playlists/playlist.service.ts,full src/services/tracks/track.service.ts,full src/core/http/client.ts,full src/core/http/errors.ts,full ``` 3. Particular code sections to focus on: - The `playlist.service.ts` and `track.service.ts` files, as they seem to contain the core functionality for interacting with the Spotify API. - The `client.ts` and `errors.ts` files in the `src/core/http` directory, as they likely handle the HTTP communication and error handling. 4. Additional context needed: - The overall purpose and high-level architecture of the project. - The specific use cases and workflows the application is designed to support. - The rationale behind the project structure and organization of the codebase. In summary, this project appears to be a set of utilities and services for interacting with the Spotify API. The main focus seems to be on managing playlists and tracks, with additional functionality for handling authentication, configuration, and error handling. To better understand the context and the specific goals of the project, the summaries of the `structure.json` and `package.json` files would be helpful.",
