  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide a base service class (`BaseService`) that encapsulates common functionality for making HTTP requests to a Spotify-related service. Key functionality includes: 1. **Dependency Injection**: The `BaseService` class takes a `ServiceDependencies` object as a constructor parameter, which contains instances of `HttpClient` and `AuthHandler`. This allows for dependency management and testability. 2. **Request Handling**: The `request` method handles various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) by making requests through the `HttpClient` instance. It also merges authentication headers obtained from the `AuthHandler` instance with the request options. 3. **Error Handling**: The `request` method uses a `ServiceErrorHandler` to handle any errors that occur during the request. The `createErrorContext` method is used to create a standardized error context object that includes information about the resource type and other relevant details. 4. **Validation**: The `validateRequiredFields` method is used to validate that a response object contains all the required fields, and the `validateMarketCode` method is used to validate a market code. Overall, this base service class provides a common set of functionality and utilities that can be used by other service classes in the application, helping to maintain consistency and reduce duplication across the codebase.",
