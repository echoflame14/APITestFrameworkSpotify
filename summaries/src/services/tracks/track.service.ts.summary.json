  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide a service for interacting with the Spotify Track API endpoints. The key functionality includes: 1. **TrackService class**: This class extends the `BaseService` class and is responsible for managing the interactions with the Spotify Track API. 2. **getTrack method**: This method fetches detailed track information from Spotify given a track ID and an optional market code. It handles the API request, validates the response, and returns the track details. 3. **validateTrackResponse method**: This private method is used to validate the track response, ensuring that all required fields are present and that the track type is either \"track\" or \"episode\". 4. **prepareRequestParams method**: This private method is responsible for preparing and validating the request parameters, including the optional market code. The service handles error cases by throwing `SpotifyHttpError` exceptions when the API request fails. The `handleResourceError` method is used to provide additional context and error handling for the track-related resource. Overall, this service provides a convenient way to interact with the Spotify Track API within a larger application or system.",
