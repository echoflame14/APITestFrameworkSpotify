  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to define a `TrackService` class that provides functionality for interacting with the Spotify Track API. This service is responsible for fetching detailed information about a specific track on Spotify. The key functionality of this service includes: 1. **Fetching Track Details**: The `getTrack` method takes a track ID and an optional market code, and retrieves the corresponding track details from the Spotify API. It handles error cases, such as when the API request fails, and validates the response to ensure that all required fields are present. 2. **Validating Request Parameters**: The `prepareRequestParams` method is responsible for validating the provided market code and preparing the request parameters accordingly. 3. **Validating Track Response**: The `validateTrackResponse` method ensures that the returned track data has the expected structure and fields. The service extends the `BaseService` class, which likely provides common functionality shared across different service classes in the application. The service also imports and utilizes various types and error classes from other parts of the application, such as `Track`, `TrackRequestParams`, and `SpotifyHttpError`. Overall, this `TrackService` class is a key component for interacting with the Spotify Track API within the application, providing a centralized and validated way to fetch track details.",
