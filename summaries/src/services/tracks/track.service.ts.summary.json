  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide a service for interacting with Spotify's Track API endpoints. The `TrackService` class extends the `BaseService` class and contains functionality for fetching detailed track information from Spotify. Key functionality: 1. The `getTrack` method fetches detailed track information from Spotify by taking a track ID and an optional market parameter. It validates the input parameters, makes the API request, and returns the track details. 2. The `validateTrackResponse` method is a private helper function that validates the response from the Spotify API, ensuring that all required fields are present and that the track type is valid. 3. The `prepareRequestParams` method is a private helper function that prepares and validates the request parameters, including the optional market code. 4. The `getResourceType` method is overridden from the `BaseService` class and returns the string `'track'`, which is used for error handling purposes. Overall, this service provides a convenient way to interact with Spotify's Track API, handling the necessary input validation, API requests, and response validation.",
