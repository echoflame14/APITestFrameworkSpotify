  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide a `SearchService` class that allows users to search the Spotify catalog for various types of content, such as albums, artists, playlists, tracks, shows, episodes, and audiobooks. Key functionality: 1. **Search**: The `search` method takes a `SearchParameters` object as input, which includes a search query, the types of content to search for, and optional filters. It then validates the input parameters, builds the search query, and makes a request to the Spotify API to retrieve the search results. 2. **Query Building**: The `buildSearchQuery` method is responsible for constructing the final search query by combining the provided search query with any applicable filters. 3. **Filter Handling**: The `buildFilterStrings` and `isValidFilterForTypes` methods handle the processing and validation of the search filters, ensuring that they are compatible with the specified search types. 4. **Parameter Validation**: The `validateSearchParams` method thoroughly validates the input `SearchParameters`, checking for empty queries, missing search types, invalid limit and offset values, and unsupported search types or filters. 5. **Response Validation**: The `validateSearchResponse` method ensures that the search response from the Spotify API contains the expected data structure and required fields for each type of content being searched. 6. **Error Handling**: The service throws `SpotifyHttpError` instances when any validation or request-related errors occur, providing detailed error information. Overall, this `SearchService` class encapsulates the logic for performing searchs on the Spotify catalog, handling input validation, query construction, and response processing, making it a key component in a Spotify-related application.",
