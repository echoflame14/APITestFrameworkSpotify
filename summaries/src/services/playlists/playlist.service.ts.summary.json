  "summary": "This TypeScript file contains the implementation of a `PlaylistService` class that provides functionality for interacting with Spotify's Playlist API endpoints. The main purpose of this service is to handle playlist retrieval, validation, and error management. The key functionality includes: 1. **Getting User Playlists**: The `getUserPlaylists` method allows fetching playlists owned or followed by a Spotify user, with support for pagination. 2. **Getting Playlist Details**: The `getPlaylist` method fetches detailed information about a specific Spotify playlist, including validation of the playlist ID and handling of various error cases. 3. **Validation and Error Handling**: The service includes various helper methods for validating input parameters and handling different types of errors that can occur when interacting with the Spotify API, such as invalid IDs, missing fields, and rate limiting. The service extends the `BaseService` class, which likely provides common functionality shared across different service classes. It utilizes the `SpotifyHttpError` and `SpotifyRateLimitError` classes to represent and handle specific types of errors. Overall, this `PlaylistService` is a key component in a larger application that integrates with the Spotify API, providing a consistent and reliable way to interact with the platform's playlist-related functionality.",
