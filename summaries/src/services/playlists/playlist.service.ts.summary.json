  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide a service for interacting with the Spotify API's playlists functionality. The key functionality includes: 1. **getUserPlaylists**: Fetches the playlists of a given user, with support for pagination through optional parameters. 2. **getPlaylist**: Retrieves a specific playlist by its ID, with optional parameters to customize the response. 3. **Validation**: Includes various validation methods to ensure that the input parameters and responses from the API are valid, throwing appropriate errors when necessary. The file defines a `PlaylistService` class that extends the `BaseService` class, which likely provides common functionality for interacting with the Spotify API. The `PlaylistService` class has methods for fetching user playlists and a specific playlist, and it also includes private validation methods to ensure the input and output data are valid. The file also imports various types and utility functions from other parts of the application, such as error handling, HTTP requests, and Spotify-specific data types.",
