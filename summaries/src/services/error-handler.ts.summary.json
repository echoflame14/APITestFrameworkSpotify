  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide a centralized error handling mechanism for Spotify API services. The `ServiceErrorHandler` class handles different types of errors that can occur during API interactions, such as: 1. **Not Found Errors**: When the requested resource (e.g., track, playlist, album, artist) is not found. 2. **Rate Limit Errors**: When the client has exceeded the rate limit for the Spotify API. 3. **Bad Request Errors**: When the client has provided invalid input, such as an incorrect market code or resource ID format. 4. **Authentication Errors**: When the client's authentication credentials are invalid or insufficient for the requested operation. 5. **Authorization Errors**: When the client does not have the necessary permissions to perform the requested operation. 6. **Generic Errors**: For any other types of errors that may occur during the API interaction. The class also provides a `validateResponse` method, which ensures that the required fields are present in the API response. Additionally, the `validateMarketCode` method is used to validate the format of the provided market code. The main functionality of this file is to centralize the error handling logic, allowing the application to provide consistent and meaningful error messages to the user, and to handle different types of errors in a standardized way across the application.",
