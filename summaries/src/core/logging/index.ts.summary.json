  "summary": "The provided TypeScript file, `index.ts`, located in the `src/core/logging/` directory, serves as the central export point for the logging functionality within the application. The main purpose of this file is to re-export the functionality from two other files: 1. `console-logger.ts`: This file likely contains the implementation of a console-based logging mechanism, which can be accessed and used throughout the application. 2. `types.ts`: This file likely defines the types and interfaces related to the logging functionality, such as log levels, logger configurations, or any other logging-specific data structures. By exporting these modules from the `index.ts` file, it allows other parts of the application to easily import and utilize the logging functionality without needing to know the specific file structure or location of the individual modules. This promotes code organization and maintainability. In summary, the main purpose of this `index.ts` file is to serve as a centralized entry point for the logging functionality, making it easily accessible and usable across the application.",
