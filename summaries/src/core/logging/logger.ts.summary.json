  "summary": "This TypeScript file, named `logger.ts`, is part of the `core/logging` module in the application. Its main purpose is to provide a centralized logging mechanism for the application. The file exports two main elements: 1. `Logger`: This is an interface that defines the contract for a logger, specifying the methods that a logger must implement, such as `log()`, `info()`, `warn()`, and `error()`. 2. `ConsoleLogger`: This is a concrete implementation of the `Logger` interface that logs messages to the console (e.g., the browser's developer console). By exporting these elements, this file serves as a central point for managing and using the logging functionality within the application. Other parts of the application can import and use the `Logger` interface and the `ConsoleLogger` implementation to handle logging tasks.",
