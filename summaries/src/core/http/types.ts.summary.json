  "summary": "This TypeScript file defines the types and interfaces used in the HTTP client implementation of the application. The main purpose of this file is to provide a consistent and type-safe way to configure and interact with the HTTP client. It defines the following key components: 1. `HttpClientConfig` interface:    - This interface defines the configuration options for the HTTP client, including `baseURL`, `timeout`, `retries`, and `retryDelay`. 2. `SafeAxiosConfig` type:    - This type is a union of the `AxiosRequestConfig` type from the `axios` library and an object with an optional `headers` property of type `AxiosHeaders` or a record of string-string key-value pairs.    - This type helps ensure that the HTTP client configuration is type-safe and compatible with the `axios` library. 3. `RetryConfig` interface:    - This interface extends the `HttpClientConfig` interface and adds an optional `currentRetry` property.    - This type is used internally within the HTTP client implementation to track the current retry attempt during a request. Overall, this file provides a centralized and type-safe way to manage the configuration and types used in the HTTP client of the application, ensuring consistency and robustness in the codebase.",
