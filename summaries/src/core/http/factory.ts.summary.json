  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide an `ErrorFactory` class that normalizes errors from different sources, including Axios errors and custom Spotify HTTP errors, into a standardized error format. Key functionality: 1. **Normalization of Errors**: The `normalizeError` method takes an error object and an optional context, and returns a `NormalizedError` object with a consistent structure. This includes errors from Spotify's custom HTTP errors and Axios errors. 2. **Spotify Error Normalization**: The `normalizeSpotifyError` method is responsible for normalizing Spotify-specific HTTP errors, extracting relevant metadata like the error code, message, status code, and other contextual information. 3. **Axios Error Normalization**: The `normalizeAxiosError` method normalizes errors originating from Axios HTTP requests, determining the appropriate error code based on the HTTP status code and extracting the error message. 4. **Unknown Error Normalization**: The `normalizeUnknownError` method handles errors that don't fit the Spotify or Axios error patterns, normalizing them into a generic `NormalizedError` object. 5. **Error Code Determination**: The `determineErrorCode` method is responsible for mapping Axios error responses to specific error codes, such as `RATE_LIMIT`, `VALIDATION`, `AUTHENTICATION`, `NOT_FOUND`, `SERVER_ERROR`, or `NETWORK`. 6. **Error Message Extraction**: The `extractErrorMessage` method extracts the error message from the Axios error response, prioritizing the message from the `error.response.data` if available. Overall, this file provides a centralized and standardized error handling mechanism for the application, ensuring that errors from different sources are normalized and presented in a consistent format.",
