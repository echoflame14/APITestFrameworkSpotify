  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide a centralized error logging mechanism for handling and logging errors that occur during HTTP requests in a Spotify application. The key functionality of this file can be summarized as follows: 1. **ErrorLogger Class**: This class is responsible for logging errors with full context and metadata. It takes a `Logger` instance as a constructor parameter, which is used to log the errors at the appropriate log level. 2. **logError Method**: This method is used to log an error. It takes a `SpotifyHttpError` object and an optional `RequestContext` object as parameters. The method creates a structured error log entry and logs it at the appropriate log level (error, warn, or info) based on the severity of the error. 3. **createErrorLog Method**: This private method is responsible for creating the structured error log entry. It extracts relevant information from the `SpotifyHttpError` object and the `RequestContext` object, and formats it into a consistent log format. 4. **sanitizeRequestContext and sanitizeHeaders Methods**: These private methods are responsible for sanitizing the request context and headers, respectively, to remove sensitive information (such as authorization tokens or API keys) before logging the error. The main purpose of this file is to provide a centralized error logging mechanism that ensures consistent and secure error reporting across the application, regardless of the source of the error.",
