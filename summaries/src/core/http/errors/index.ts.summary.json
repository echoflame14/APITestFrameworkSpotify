  "summary": "The provided TypeScript file, `src/core/http/errors/index.ts`, serves as a central hub for exporting various types, constants, and error classes related to HTTP errors in a Spotify application. The main purposes and key functionalities of this file are: 1. **Exporting Base Types**: It exports a set of base types, such as `ErrorCode`, `BaseErrorContext`, `ErrorTypeMetadata`, `NormalizedError`, `RequestContext`, `SpotifyErrorData`, `SpotifyErrorResponse`, and `StructuredErrorLog`, which are likely used throughout the application for handling and managing errors. 2. **Exporting Constants**: It exports two constants, `ERROR_CODES` and `ERROR_REGISTRY`, which are likely defined in a separate `./constants.ts` file and serve as a single source of truth for error-related information. 3. **Exporting Spotify Error Classes**: It exports three custom error classes: `SpotifyHttpError`, `SpotifyRateLimitError`, and `SpotifyValidationError`, which are likely used to represent specific types of errors that can occur in the Spotify application. 4. **Exporting the Error Logger**: It exports the `ErrorLogger` class, which is likely responsible for logging and managing error-related information within the application. In summary, this file acts as a centralized entry point for error-related functionality in the Spotify application, providing a consistent and organized way to work with different types of errors, constants, and error-handling utilities.",
