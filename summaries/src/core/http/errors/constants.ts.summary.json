  "summary": "This TypeScript file defines a set of error codes and their corresponding metadata, which are used to handle different types of errors that can occur in the application. The main purpose of this file is to provide a centralized and consistent way of managing and representing errors across the application. The key functionality of this file includes: 1. **Error Codes**: It defines a set of error codes, such as `RATE_LIMIT`, `VALIDATION`, `NETWORK`, `AUTHENTICATION`, `NOT_FOUND`, `INVALID_ID`, `INVALID_MARKET`, `SERVER_ERROR`, and `UNKNOWN`, which are used to represent different types of errors that can occur in the application. 2. **Error Registry**: It creates an `ERROR_REGISTRY` object, which maps each error code to a specific metadata object. This metadata includes information such as the error code, whether the error is retryable, a default error message, the severity of the error, and the corresponding HTTP status code. This file provides a centralized and consistent way of handling errors in the application, making it easier to manage and communicate errors to the users or other parts of the system. By using this error registry, the application can provide more meaningful and informative error messages, and handle errors in a more consistent and predictable manner.",
