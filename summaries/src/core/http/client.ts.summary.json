  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide a custom `HttpClient` class that wraps the Axios HTTP client library. The key functionality of this class includes: 1. **Setup and Configuration**: The `HttpClient` constructor takes in a `HttpClientConfig` object and a `Logger` instance. It initializes the Axios client with the provided configuration, including a base URL, timeout, and default headers. 2. **Request Interceptors**: The `setupInterceptors()` method sets up request and response interceptors. The request interceptor logs the initiated request, while the response interceptor logs the received response. 3. **Error Handling and Retrying**: The `transformError()` method handles and transforms Axios errors into custom `SpotifyHttpError` and `SpotifyRateLimitError` instances, providing more detailed error information. The `handleRequestError()` method implements a retry mechanism, automatically retrying failed requests up to a configured number of times with exponential backoff. 4. **Utility Methods**: The class includes various utility methods, such as `parseRetryAfter()`, `createGenericError()`, `shouldRetry()`, `calculateBackoff()`, and `sanitizeError()`, which handle specific error-related tasks. 5. **HTTP Request Methods**: The class provides wrapper methods for common HTTP requests (`get()`, `post()`, `put()`, and `delete()`), which handle error transformation and retry logic. The main purpose of this `HttpClient` class is to provide a centralized and consistent way of making HTTP requests, with built-in error handling, retrying, and logging functionality, specifically tailored for use within a Spotify-related application.",
