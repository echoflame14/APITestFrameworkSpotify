  "summary": "This TypeScript file, `errors.ts`, is part of the core HTTP functionality of a Spotify-related application. The main purpose of this file is to define and handle various types of errors that can occur when making HTTP requests to the Spotify API. The key functionality of this file includes: 1. **Error Types**: It defines several custom error classes, such as `SpotifyHttpError`, `SpotifyRateLimitError`, `SpotifyAuthenticationError`, `SpotifyValidationError`, and `TrackValidationError`. These classes extend the built-in `Error` class and provide additional properties and methods to handle different types of errors. 2. **Error Response Interfaces**: It defines two interfaces, `SpotifyErrorResponse` and `SpotifyErrorData`, to represent the structure of error responses from the Spotify API. 3. **Error Handling**: The file provides utility functions like `SpotifyHttpError.createFromError()`, `enhanceErrorWithContext()`, `isRetryableError()`, `areSameErrorType()`, and `isInstanceOfSpotifyError()` to handle and manipulate errors. 4. **Error Metadata**: The `getMetadata()` method of the `SpotifyHttpError` class retrieves error-specific metadata, such as status codes and whether the error is retryable, from a central registry. 5. **Error Normalization**: The `toNormalizedError()` method of the `SpotifyHttpError` class creates a standardized `NormalizedError` object, which can be used for consistent error handling and reporting across the application. Overall, this file provides a comprehensive error handling system for a Spotify-related application, making it easier to manage and respond to different types of errors that may occur during API interactions.",
