  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to manage the configuration settings for a Spotify-related application. The key functionality is as follows: 1. **Load Environment Variables**: The file uses the `dotenv` library to load environment variables, which are expected to contain the necessary Spotify credentials and configuration settings. 2. **Validate Spotify Credentials**: The file checks that the required Spotify client ID and client secret are present in the environment variables. If they are not, it throws an error. 3. **Load and Store Configuration**: The file loads the Spotify configuration settings from the environment variables and stores them in a private `config` property of the `ConfigManager` class. The configuration settings include the Spotify token endpoint, API base URL, timeout, retry settings, and more. 4. **Provide Config Access**: The file exposes a `getConfig()` method that allows other parts of the application to access the loaded Spotify configuration settings. The `ConfigManager` class is responsible for managing the Spotify configuration and ensuring that the necessary credentials and settings are available for the application to use when interacting with the Spotify API.",
