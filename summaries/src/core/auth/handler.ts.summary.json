  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide an `AuthHandler` class that manages the authentication process for a service. The class is responsible for fetching and managing access tokens for making authenticated requests. Key functionality: 1. **Configuration Validation**: The `AuthHandler` class validates the provided `AuthConfig` object to ensure that the required fields (clientId, clientSecret, tokenEndpoint) are present. 2. **Token Fetching**: The `initialize()` method is used to fetch the initial access token. The `fetchNewToken()` method is responsible for making an HTTP POST request to the token endpoint with the client credentials to obtain a new access token. 3. **Token Management**: The `getValidToken()` method checks if the current token is expired, and if so, fetches a new token. The `getAuthHeader()` method returns an authorization header object with the valid access token. 4. **Error Handling**: The `fetchNewToken()` method catches any errors that occur during the token fetching process and logs the relevant information using the provided `Logger` instance. Overall, the `AuthHandler` class provides a centralized way to manage the authentication process, ensuring that valid access tokens are available for making authenticated requests to the service.",
