  "summary": "The provided TypeScript file, `config.ts`, is part of the core authentication module of an application. Its main purpose is to define the structure of the authentication configuration and provide a utility function to validate the configuration. The key functionality of this file is: 1. **AuthConfig Interface**: It defines the structure of the authentication configuration object, which includes `clientId`, `clientSecret`, and an optional `tokenEndpoint`. 2. **DEFAULT_TOKEN_ENDPOINT**: It provides a default value for the `tokenEndpoint` property, which is set to `'https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token'`. 3. **validateAuthConfig Function**: This function takes an `AuthConfig` object as input and validates the required properties (`clientId` and `clientSecret`). If any of these properties are missing, it throws an error. Otherwise, it returns a new `AuthConfig` object, ensuring that the `tokenEndpoint` property is either the provided value or the `DEFAULT_TOKEN_ENDPOINT`. This file is likely used in other parts of the application to ensure that the authentication configuration is properly set up and validated before being used in the authentication process.",
