  "summary": "This TypeScript file, `debug-auth.ts`, is a script that demonstrates the functionality of the `AuthHandler` class, which is responsible for handling authentication with Spotify's API. The main purpose of this file is to provide a way to test and debug the authentication process. It performs the following key functionality: 1. Loads environment variables using the `dotenv` library, which are expected to contain the necessary Spotify API credentials (client ID, client secret, and token endpoint). 2. Logs the status of the loaded environment variables (whether they are present or missing). 3. Creates a `ConsoleLogger` instance to handle logging during the authentication process. 4. Configures the `AuthHandler` with the loaded environment variables. 5. Initializes the `AuthHandler` and, if successful, logs a message indicating that the authentication was successful. 6. If an error occurs during the authentication process, it logs the error message. The `debugAuth()` function is called at the end of the script, and any errors that occur are caught and logged using `console.error`. In summary, this script is a utility for developers to test and debug the authentication process for interacting with the Spotify API, ensuring that the necessary environment variables are correctly set and the authentication flow is working as expected.",
