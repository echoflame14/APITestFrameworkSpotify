  "summary": "This TypeScript file is a test suite for a Spotify track service. The main purpose of this file is to test the happy path functionality of the track service, which includes fetching track details, verifying track metadata, and checking for market availability. Key functionality: 1. **Setup Test Context**: The `beforeAll` hook sets up the test context by calling the `setupTestContext` function, which initializes the necessary dependencies for the tests. 2. **Fetch Bohemian Rhapsody Track Details**: The first test case checks if the track service can fetch the details of the \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" track. It verifies the basic track information, such as the track ID, type, and artist name. 3. **Fetch Track with Market Parameter**: The second test case checks if the track service can fetch the details of the \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" track with a specific market parameter (in this case, \"US\"). It verifies the track ID and type, and also checks if the track is available in the specified market. 4. **Verify Track Metadata Fields**: The third test case checks if the track service returns the expected track metadata fields, such as the track ID, name, type, URI, duration, and explicit flag. The test suite uses the `setupTestContext` function to set up the necessary dependencies, including the track service, console logger, and HTTP error handling. It also utilizes constants defined in the `@/__tests__/utils/constants` module, such as the `TRACK_IDS` and `TEST_TIMEOUTS`.",
