  "summary": "This TypeScript file contains integration tests for the Spotify Playlist Service. The main purpose of this file is to ensure the correct functionality of the Spotify Playlist Service by testing various scenarios, including: 1. **Fetching Complete Playlist Metadata**: This test verifies that the `getPlaylist` method of the `playlistService` correctly fetches and returns the complete metadata for a given playlist. 2. **Handling Playlist Not Found Error**: This test ensures that the `getPlaylist` method correctly handles the case where a non-existent playlist ID is provided, returning a `PLAYLIST_NOT_FOUND` error. 3. **Rejecting Invalid Playlist ID Formats**: This test checks that the `getPlaylist` method rejects playlist IDs with invalid formats, returning an `INVALID_ID_FORMAT` error. The file sets up a test context using the `setupTestContext` function, which is likely defined in the `./utils/setup` module. The `TEST_TIMEOUTS` and `TEST_DATA` constants are imported from the `./utils/constants` and `./utils/test-data` modules, respectively. Additionally, the file imports the `axios` library and the `SpotifyRateLimitError` from the `../core/http/errors` module, which suggests that the tests may involve making HTTP requests to the Spotify API and handling rate limit errors.",
