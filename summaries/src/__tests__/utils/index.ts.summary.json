  "summary": "This TypeScript (`.ts`) file is located in the `src/__tests__/utils` directory and serves as an entry point for exporting various utility functions and data used in the project's tests. The main purpose of this file is to centralize the export of the following key functionality: 1. `setup`: This module likely contains functions or configurations related to setting up the testing environment or mocking dependencies. 2. `constraints`: This module contains utility functions or data related to constraints or rules that are used in the tests. 3. `test-data`: This module provides test data, such as sample inputs or expected outputs, that can be reused across different test cases. By exporting these modules from a single file, the project can easily import and use the various testing utilities and data throughout the test suite, promoting code organization and reusability.",
