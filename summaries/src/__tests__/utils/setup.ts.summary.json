  "summary": "This TypeScript file is part of a test setup for a music-related application. Its main purpose is to provide a centralized setup function that initializes and returns the necessary services and dependencies required for running tests. The key functionality of this file includes: 1. **Environment Variables**: It loads the environment variables using the `dotenv` library, which are likely used to configure the application's authentication and connectivity settings. 2. **Test Context**: It defines a `TestContext` interface that represents the set of services and dependencies required for the tests, including `TrackService`, `PlaylistService`, `HttpClient`, `AuthHandler`, and `ConsoleLogger`. 3. **Setup Function**: The `setupTestContext()` function is responsible for initializing and configuring the required services and dependencies. This includes:    - Initializing the `ConsoleLogger` for logging purposes.    - Setting up the `AuthHandler` with the necessary authentication configuration (client ID, client secret, and token endpoint).    - Initializing the `HttpClient` with the base URL, timeout, retry settings, and the logger.    - Initializing the `TrackService` and `PlaylistService` with the necessary dependencies (HTTP client and auth handler).    - Returning the initialized `TestContext` object, which contains all the required services and dependencies. This setup file is likely used in the application's test suite to provide a consistent and standardized way of setting up the necessary dependencies for running tests, ensuring that the tests have access to the required services and configurations.",
