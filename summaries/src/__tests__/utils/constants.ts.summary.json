  "summary": "This TypeScript file serves as a collection of constants and utility functions used for testing purposes in a project that interacts with the Spotify API. Key functionalities: 1. **Constants**:    - `TRACK_IDS`: Defines a set of predefined Spotify track IDs for various scenarios, such as a \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" track, a compilation track, a single track, a geo-restricted track, and a non-existent track.    - `PLAYLIST_IDS`: Defines a set of predefined Spotify playlist IDs, including a \"Top 50 Global\" playlist and a \"Custom Playlist\".    - `MARKETS`: Defines a set of market codes, including \"US\", \"JP\", \"GB\", and an \"INVALID\" market code.    - `TEST_TIMEOUTS`: Defines various timeout values in milliseconds for different types of tests, such as \"QUICK\", \"NORMAL\", \"EXTENDED\", and \"NETWORK\". 2. **Type Aliases**:    - `TrackId`, `PlaylistId`, `Market`, and `TimeoutType`: These are type aliases that ensure type safety when working with the corresponding constants. 3. **Spotify API Response Structures**:    - `SpotifyImage`, `SpotifyArtist`, and `SpotifyAlbum`: These interfaces define the expected structure of Spotify API responses for various entities, such as images, artists, and albums. 4. **Utility Function**:    - `validateTestEnvironment`: This function checks if the required environment variables (`SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`) are present in the project's environment. If any of them are missing, it throws an error with a message instructing the user to add the missing variables to the `.env` file. The main purpose of this file is to provide a centralized location for managing constants, types, and utility functions that are crucial for testing the integration with the Spotify API within the project.",
