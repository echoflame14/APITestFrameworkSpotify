  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to test the error handling capabilities of the `TrackService` in the context of a Spotify-related application. The file contains a series of tests that cover different types of errors that the service might encounter, including: 1. **Non-existent track IDs**: The test checks that the service correctly handles the case where a requested track ID does not exist in the system. 2. **Rate limiting**: The test simulates a scenario where the service is hit with multiple requests in a short period of time, testing that the service handles the rate limiting gracefully. 3. **Network errors**: The test checks that the service correctly handles network-related errors, such as when the API endpoint is not available or the connection is refused. The file uses the `setupTestContext` function to create a test context, which provides the necessary dependencies for the `TrackService` being tested. The `dotenv` library is used to load environment variables, which are likely used in the setup process. The tests are defined using the `describe` and `test` functions, and they use the `TestContext` interface to interact with the `TrackService` and the underlying HTTP client. The `TEST_TIMEOUTS` constants are used to set appropriate timeouts for the different types of tests. The file also includes an `afterEach` hook that adds a delay between tests to avoid triggering rate limiting issues during the test suite execution.",
