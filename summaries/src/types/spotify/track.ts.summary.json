  "summary": "This TypeScript file provides comprehensive type definitions for Spotify track-related entities, including interfaces for tracks, albums, artists, and related metadata. The main purpose of this file is to establish a standardized set of types and interfaces that can be used throughout a Spotify-related application or library. Key functionality: 1. **External IDs**: Defines an interface `ExternalIds` for representing various external identification systems for tracks, such as ISRC, EAN, and UPC. 2. **Restrictions**: Defines an interface `RestrictionInfo` for representing track restrictions by market or other factors, using a `RestrictionReason` type. 3. **Linked Tracks**: Defines an interface `LinkedTrack` for representing linked tracks used for territory-specific track relinking. 4. **Artists**: Defines an interface `Artist` for representing artists with essential metadata. 5. **Albums**: Defines an interface `Album` for representing albums with comprehensive metadata, including album type, release date, and restrictions. 6. **Tracks**: Defines a comprehensive interface `Track` for representing Spotify track objects, including properties such as album, artists, availability, duration, and more. 7. **Request Parameters**: Defines an interface `TrackRequestParams` for representing parameters used in track-related API requests. 8. **Track Validation**: Defines an interface `TrackValidation` for validating essential track properties, and a `isValidTrack` function that can be used to validate a given track object. 9. **Track Validation Error**: Defines a custom `TrackValidationError` class for handling track validation failures. 10. **Track Summary**: Provides a `getTrackSummary` function that extracts simplified track information (such as ID, name, artists, duration, and album name) from a valid `Track` object. Overall, this file serves as a centralized location for managing the complex data structures associated with Spotify tracks, albums, and artists, and provides utilities for validating and extracting essential information from these entities.",
