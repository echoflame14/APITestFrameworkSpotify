  "summary": "This JSON file is a TypeScript configuration file, commonly known as a `tsconfig.json` file. Its main purpose is to specify the compiler options and settings for a TypeScript project. The key functionality of this configuration file includes: 1. **Compile Target**: The project is set to target the ECMAScript 2020 (es2020) standard. 2. **Module System**: The project is using the CommonJS module system. 3. **Strict Type Checking**: The `strict` option is set to `true`, enabling strict type checking for the project. 4. **ES Modules Interoperability**: The `esModuleInterop` option is set to `true`, allowing for seamless interoperability between ES modules and CommonJS modules. 5. **Type Definition File Generation**: The `declaration` option is set to `true`, which will generate type definition (`.d.ts`) files during the build process. 6. **Testing Dependencies**: The project includes the `jest` and `node` type definitions. 7. **Absolute Imports**: The `baseUrl` and `paths` options are configured to allow for absolute imports using the `@/` prefix, which maps to the `src/` directory. 8. **JSON Module Resolution**: The `resolveJsonModule` option is set to `true`, allowing the project to import JSON files. 9. **Include and Exclude Directories**: The `include` option specifies that the `src/` and `scripts/` directories should be included in the compilation, while the `exclude` option excludes the `node_modules/` and `dist/` directories. Overall, this `tsconfig.json` file sets up the TypeScript compiler options for a project, enabling strict type checking, generating type definition files, and configuring absolute imports and JSON module resolution.",
