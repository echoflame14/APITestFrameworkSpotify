  "summary": "The main purpose of this plan is to refactor the error handling system in the codebase. The plan is divided into five phases: 1. **Create Core Error Types**: This phase involves creating a set of core error types, interfaces, and utilities to provide a consistent and centralized error handling system. 2. **Consolidate Error Classes**: In this phase, the existing error classes are moved to a centralized location, and common interfaces and utility functions are defined. 3. **Service Layer Error Handling**: This phase focuses on moving the error handling logic from the base service to a dedicated error handler service, providing a more organized and consistent approach. 4. **Clean Up and Integration**: This phase involves updating the existing codebase to use the new error handling structure, removing obsolete files, and cleaning up the overall code organization. 5. **Update Tests**: The final phase ensures that the tests are updated to reflect the changes made in the error handling system. The key functionality of this refactoring plan is to create a more robust, scalable, and maintainable error handling system in the codebase. By defining core error types, consolidating error classes, and centralizing the error handling logic, the plan aims to improve the overall quality and maintainability of the application.",
