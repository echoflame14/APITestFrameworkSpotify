  "summary": "The main purpose of this plan is to improve the error handling functionality in the application to make it more testable and easier to build new tests. The key elements of the plan are: 1. **Error Normalization & Standardization**:    - Create a consistent error format with standardized error codes, messages, and context.    - Ensure all errors pass through a normalization pipeline before being thrown. 2. **Error Context Expansion**:    - Enrich error contexts with request-specific metadata (e.g., endpoint, method, params, headers) and user-friendly error messages.    - Add a timestamp to all errors for tracking when they occurred. 3. **Error Type Registry**:    - Define a centralized registry for error types and metadata (code, retryable, default message, severity).    - Use the registry to enforce consistency across error creation. 4. **Test Utilities for Errors**:    - Create a `TestErrorFactory` for generating mock errors.    - Add assertion helpers for error testing.    - Provide utilities for simulating network failures and rate limit errors. 5. **Enhanced Error Logging**:    - Implement structured logging for errors, including request and response details. 6. **Documentation for Testers**:    - Document the error normalization and context enrichment process.    - Provide examples for testing common error scenarios. The plan outlines a phased implementation approach to deliver these improvements, focusing on making errors more consistent, testable, and debuggable, as well as providing utilities to simplify testing.",
