  "summary": "The provided .txt file outlines a checklist for implementing error handling in a Spotify API client implementation. The main purpose of this implementation is to ensure robust and comprehensive error handling across various components of the application. The key functionality and tasks outlined in the checklist are: 1. **Error Framework**: Implement utilities and type guards to enable error comparison and normalization, ensuring consistent error handling across the application. 2. **Normalization Pipeline**: Complete the error normalization process, including standardizing error codes and creating a dependency on the corresponding test suite. 3. **Exponential Backoff**: Implement an exponential backoff mechanism for retrying failed API requests, to handle temporary network issues. 4. **Schema Validation Templates**: Create a reusable factory for schema validation, and add JSON Schema definitions for core data types. 5. **Track-specific Validation**: Implement track-specific error handling, including a custom `TrackValidationError` subclass and detection of relinking issues. 6. **Audio Analysis Error Handling**: Handle errors related to audio analysis functionality, including creating an `AudioAnalysisError` class and adding waveform data validation. 7. **Context Preservation Tests**: Ensure that error context is preserved through multiple layers of error wrapping, and verify the correctness of market codes in error metadata. 8. **Network Failure Simulations**: Test the application's behavior in the face of network failures, including mocking 502/503 error scenarios and testing the retry behavior. 9. **Documentation**: Provide a guide for understanding and utilizing the implemented error handling patterns, such as the `enhanceErrorWithContext` approach. The checklist also outlines critical dependencies between the various tasks, ensuring that the implementation is carried out in a coordinated and cohesive manner.",
